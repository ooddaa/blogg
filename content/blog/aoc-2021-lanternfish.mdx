# Lanternfish

[Lanternfish](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6) grow exponentially! As does any population that just procreates over and over. They must be immortal or something... 

One of the approaches for this task is to use a **genetic algorithm**. Genetic algorithms evolve a population over a number of generations.

## Introduction

I'll be honest with you, genetic algorithms are not something I ever expected to use in my day-to-day Elixir. [But this awesome talk by Sean Moriarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWXSiZ-vi-o) introduced me to the concept and I immediately ordered Sean's book: [Genetic Algorithms in Elixir: Solve Problems Using Evolution](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Genetic-Algorithms-Elixir-Problems-Evolution/dp/168050794X/).

I mean, who wouldn't want Mother Nature to help you out with Advent Of Code, for example? Yep!

### Part 1

As always, I solved the first part of the puzzle, the most straightforward and naïve way possible - with a list. Here's the rough idea:

```elixir
# set initial conditions
# define logic to increment a fish per day
# repeat N of epochs, growing the list 
```

It worked, as the resulting list had to be iterated over only 80 times. Quite manageable for a LiveBook session.

Surely enough *Part 2* made it WAY harder 😂, and my naïve algo did not even finish.

### Part 2

Why is it still going?? 🤔 I asked myself after 10/20/60sec of waiting. Ah I see, that pesky `exponential` in front of `growth`. 

Lol, nope 😁. Alright, what do we have here?

## The actual problem

Well it turns out that tracking each individual unit of the population (aka 🐟) by assigning it a position in a list is not what we want here at all. Even if prepending elements to lists is an `O(1)` operation in Elixir, searching the list is still `O(n)`. And since the list will start growing at `O(n^x)` at some point, the whole thing escalate to a crazy exponential time complexity. And I'm still figuring out how to assess the **x**.

## Insight 1

What we want is to reduce the units of work done. Ie to make **x** as small as possible, ideally all the way to 0. Since most work is done because of searching the list (insertion is cheap), we will gain the most by focusing on a datastructure that has O(1) lookup cost. A [hash table/hashmap/map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) that is.

## Insight 2

Now we need to figure out how to make a hashmap useful for our case. We need to reduce dimensionality of our problem: stop focusing on each fish and focus on groups with similar attributes. As the only attribute we are tracking there is *age*, let's track the age groups.

```elixir
# our map represents ages as keys 
# and size of the age population as value
# %{ age => group_size }
``` 

Important note: our `age` is `age_before_fish_becomes_a_parent_age`, so we will be decrementing it. In line with the puzzle's description.

## Insight 3

I've mentioned `population`, `iteration` and `growing` which sounds like a use case to implement a genetic algorithm.

## Genetic algorithm

> Genetic algorithms work via *transformations* on *populations of chromosomes* over some number of *generations*.

In our case: 

```elixir
# chormosome
each {age, size} bucket
# population of chromosomes
map of 9 {age, size} buckets
# transformations
change age, change size 
# number of generations 
days
```

### Steps

Our map describes all the fish civilization at a point in time. Hence we are going to plug our map into genetic algorithm to define the population.

The steps are:

```elixir
create_population(input)
|> evaluate()
|> select_parents()
|> procreate()
|> repeat()
```

Which translates into a skeleton module:

```elixir
defmodule Fish do
  @moduledoc """

  """
  def population(input) do
    # our %{ age => group_size } 
    # map goes in here as input
  end

  def select_parents(population) do
    # who is going to produce children
  end

  def procreate(population) do
    # happy Birthday everyone! 
    # record birth certificates etc
  end

  def count(population) do
    # we need a final answer 
    # to be an integer
  end

  def run(population, days) do
    # run, Nature, run!
    # do another cycle if needed
  end
end
```

## Solution

Once I have a skeleton of the solution (which I am sure is gonna work, because Mother Nature said so), I just throw myself against the keyboard until the test input answer matches.

### 1. Population

Step one: define a population.

```elixir
defmodule Fish do

  @doc"""
  I want represent population as a
  collection of {age, size} buckets. 
  Then it will have all the info that
  I need to:
  - select_parents
  - procreate

  Example:
  Fish.population([3, 4, 3, 1, 2])
  %{0 => 0, 1 => 1, 2 => 1, 3 => 2, 
  4 => 1, 5 => 0, 6 => 0, 7 => 0, 8 => 0}
  
  Which tells us that we have 
  {3, 2} == two fishes that have 
  3 days before they produce 3 baby-fishes. 
  I want to pad age buckets to have a full 
  picture of the population per age group.
  Therefore we need to add the 
  %{5 => 0, 6 => 0, 7 => 0, 8 => 0} bit
  """
  def population(input) do
    0..8
    |> Enum.map(&{&1, 0})
    |> Map.new()
    |> Map.merge(Enum.frequencies(input))
  end

end
```

### 2. Select Parents

Step two: find out how many parents we will work with. In our case it's easy - just pick the {"0"} age bucket (0 days left to have the baby).

```elixir
defmodule Fish do

  ...

  @doc"""
  The easiest part, as our data 
  structure has the answer ready
  """
  def select_parents(population) do 
    Map.get(population, 0, 0)
  end  

end
```

### 3. Procreate!!

I decided to lump a bunch of things together here because I think of them as happening all at once and they all constitute one `transition` between old and new states:

- `add children`
- `age population` 
- `reset parents`

```elixir
defmodule Fish do

  ...

  @doc"""
  I'm going to keep all "generation 
  moving forward" actions in one 
  place. It should really be called 
  "evolve(population)" but I'm bad 
  at naming things until it's too late. 
  """
  def procreate(population) do
    # get the parents as they 
    # also represent the number 
    # of children as per "One baby 
    # fish per parent per week" policy.
    parents = select_parents(population)

    population
    |> Enum.map(fn
      # baby making part
      {age, size} when age == 0 -> 
        {8, size}  
      # everyone is getting older part
      {age, size} -> 
        {age - 1, size}          
    end)
    |> Map.new()
    # parents get a week long rest
    |> Map.update(6, 0, &(&1 + parents))      
  end

end
```

### 4. Count and run

Fuf, hopefully we have not run into a pesky `n+1` problem here, so let's wrap up with counting and termination criteria.

```elixir
defmodule Fish do

  ...

  @doc"""
  Easy-peasy, count the fish!
  """
  def count(population) do
    population
    |> Map.values()
    |> Enum.sum()
  end

  @doc"""
  Stop once we have no 
  days/generations left.
  Othervise, go on, fish, 
  frolic all you like! 
  """
  def run(population, 0) do 
    count(population)
  end

  def run(population, days) do
    run(procreate(population), days - 1)
  end

end
```

### The whole thing

Also on my [Github](https://github.com/ooddaa/advent_of_code/blob/main/2021/elixir/day-06/day-06.livemd).

```elixir
defmodule Fish do

  @doc"""

    parents = select_parents(population)

    population
    |> Enum.map(fn
      # baby making part
      {age, size} when age == 0 -> 
        {8, size}  
      # everyone is getting older part
      {age, size} -> 
        {age - 1, size}          
    end)
    |> Map.new()
    # parents get a week long rest
    |> Map.update(6, 0, &(&1 + parents))      
  end

  @doc"""

  """
  def count(population) do
    population
    |> Map.values()
    |> Enum.sum()
  end

  @doc"""

  frolic all you like! 
  """
  def run(population, 0) do 
    count(population)
  end

  def run(population, days) do
    run(procreate(population), days - 1)
  end
end
```

### Conclusion

This gave me answer in no time, as all this algo does is adding groups of fish and creating a few maps along the way.

**Time complexity:** O(9) as all we do is to access each of 9 keys, and do addition/substraction  
**Space complexity:** O(1) as we only create a simple map to deal with the problem.

That's an improvement! What it definitely doesn't do is creating loooooooong lists, iterating over them, incrementing each element.

Instead, it works with `populations`, groupped by age, evolving them over a number of generations. Each population is very efficiently represented as a collection of `{age, size}` buckets. These tuples are perfect as they can be worked with by Enum and Map modules with no fuzz at all.

To sum up, the genetic algorithm approach helps to clearly state the problem and offers an intuitive step-by-step progression that we all know and owe to Mother Nature herself.
